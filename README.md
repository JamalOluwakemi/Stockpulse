# ðŸ“Š StockPulse Dashboard  

StockPulse is a **Flask-based anomaly detection dashboard** for stock market data.  
It allows users to upload CSV stock datasets, run anomaly detection and feature engineering, and visualize results through an interactive web UI.  

The dashboard highlights anomalies in stock prices and provides downloadable anomaly reports. It also includes charts for visual analysis of stock trends with anomalies.

A screen recording showing the StockPulse dashboard in action is included in the `StockPulse_Demo` folder.


## Features  

- **Upload Stock Data:** Upload CSV files containing stock market data with fields like Date, Close, Volume, etc.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses **Isolation Forest** and other algorithms to detect unusual spikes, dips, or patterns in stock prices.  
- **Highlight Anomalies:** Detected anomalies are highlighted in the results table for easy visualization.  
- **Interactive Charts:** View stock price trends over time with anomalies marked on the charts.  
- **Download Reports:** Export anomaly detection results as CSV reports for further analysis or documentation.  
- **Sample Data Provided:** Test the dashboard quickly with a sample stock CSV included in the project.  
- **Simple & Professional UI:** User-friendly dashboard built with Flask and Bootstrap for easy navigation and interaction.
