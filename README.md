# ðŸ“Š StockPulse Dashboard  

StockPulse is a **Flask-based anomaly detection dashboard** for stock market data.  
It allows users to upload CSV stock datasets, run anomaly detection and feature engineering, and visualize results through an interactive web UI.  

The dashboard highlights anomalies in stock prices and provides downloadable anomaly reports. It also includes charts for visual analysis of stock trends with anomalies.
